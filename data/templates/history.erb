<%= color Palette::BLUE_ON_BLACK %>Hail <%= char_name %>

<%= color Palette::YELLOW_ON_BLACK %>I'll ask of the berserks, you tasters of blood,
Those intrepid heroes, how are they treated,
Those who wade out into battle?
Wolf-skinned they are called. In battle
They bear bloody shields.
Red with blood are their spears when they come to fight.
They form a closed group.
The prince in his wisdom puts trust in such men
Who hack through enemy shields.
